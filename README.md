<h1>SpaceShot - A realistic* space shooter</h1>
<h2>By: ElectricErger</h2>
One night, I was studying for my final the next day in networking. The class had a project and some of the projects that were presented featured networked video games. I figured, why not do one myself?
Thus began the worst idea in history. My first video game. The exam was the next morning, so I made the worst decision of my life: stay up till dawn making the game. Regardless of this awful miscalculation I still managed to get a B+ in that class thanks to my work at Alcatel-Lucent.

In all seriousness, SpaceShot is a java game where you're traveling in space shooting anything that gets in your way. The game features powerups like rock seaking missiles and an inertial dampener. The realism comes more from the lack of inertial dampening: if you stop pressing a button, you still have inertia.

Future features:
-More enemies
-Customizable ships
-High scores
